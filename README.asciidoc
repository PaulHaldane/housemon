= Random environmental data monitoring collection, presentation and alerting

Random collection of scripts, programs and configs to gather environmental data
either from local sensors attached to Arduinos or web services for sensors managed
by other people (e.g. Urban Observatory).

Local sensors generally attached to XinoRf Arduinos which send readings wirelessly to a Rasperry Pi with
Slice of Pi XinoRf attached.

Some alerting done via perl script sending to Slack via web hook.
Also send readings to dweet.io for later use by local instance of freeboard
and option to store long term in mongodb.
